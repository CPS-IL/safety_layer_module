This repository implements a [cyber-rt](https://cyber-rt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) component, a safety layer for [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) 5.0, that detects obstacle existence detection faults, overriding control outputs to brake to halt if such faults, posing a risk of collision, are detected.
